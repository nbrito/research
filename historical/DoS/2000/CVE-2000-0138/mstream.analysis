Introduction
------------

The following is an analysis of "mstream", a distributed denial of
service (DDoS) attack tool, based on the source code of "stream2.c", a
classic point-to-point DoS attack tool [12].

There are currently seven major code bases of recognized DDoS tools
witnessed in use "in the wild" for executing DDoS attacks:

	trinoo [03]
	Tribe Flood Network (TFN) [04]
	Tribe Flood Network 2000 (tfn2k) [06]
	stacheldraht/stacheldrahtV4 [05]
	stacheldraht v2.666
	shaft [07]
	mstream

mstream is more primitive than any of the other DDoS tools.
Examination of reverse engineered and recovered C source code reveals
the program to be in early development stages, with numerous bugs and
an incomplete feature set compared with any of the other listed
tools.  The effectiveness of the stream/stream2 attack itself,
however, means that it will still be disruptive to the victim (and
agent) networks even with an attack network consisting of only a hand
full of agents.

(The source code for mstream was anonymously posted to the
vuln-dev@securityfocus.com and BUGTRAQ email lists on April 29, 2000. [20]
As a result, this analysis is being released in a bit less polished
and complete form that originally intended, but will hopefully allow
incident response teams and vendors to save some time in developing
their responses.  Any errors we didn't catch are likely a result of this
rush.)

The reader is advised that modification of the source code can and would
change any of the details of this analysis, such as prompts, passwords,
commands, TCP/UDP port numbers, or supported attack methods, signatures,
and features.  In fact, the values of communication ports have already
been seen to differ between published and "in the wild" code.

[Note also that throughout this analysis, actual nicks,
site names, and IP addresses have been sanitized.]

The handler/agent terminology used in this analysis was developed at the
CERT Distributed System Intruder Tools workshop held in November 1999,
and will be used in this analysis.  It is highly recommended that the
CERT workshop report [01] be read first, as well as background and
supporting information on other DDoS tools [08]:

An mstream agent was discovered in late April 2000 on a compromised
Linux system at a major university.  This system was identified to be
flooding packets using forged source addresses, targeted at over a dozen
IP addresses.

Since RFC 2267 style egress filtering [13] was employed on this network,
and all 32 bits of the source addresses were forged, only an extremely
small number of attack packets (matching the internal network blocks)
could have managed to leave the agent's network.  The traffic did,
however, cause the router (which served 18 subnets) to become
non-responsive.  This means that sites that do egress filtering may
still suffer from these attacks themselves, even if the intended
"victim" receives fewer packets than the attacker(s) intended.  The
lesson here is that there is no "quick fix" to DDoS in the form of
simple technical filtering solutions. [The router manufacturer was
briefed and is currently working on identifying the cause and
fixes.]

Another side-effect of taking egress filtering down one level to that
of internal subnets is that rejected packets will not make it past the
router doing the filtering, so the effects of bandwidth consumption or
router disruption will not be felt above the level of the router
doing the filtering (or being saturated).  This means a border router
based IDS (e.g., net flows), or one outside your borders on a DMZ or
upstream ISP's network, will not identify the attempted attacks.  Unless
you are monitoring the routers themselves, only user complaints would
tip you off to an attack originating from your network.  It also means
that packet level analysis is made more difficult, as it must be done
*in front* of the router doing the filtering in order to capture all
packets.  This puts an added burden on network engineers or incident
responders to do packet level dumping, on site in a router closet,
in order to know with a high degree of reliability what is going on.

A major problem in forensic analysis of these attacks -- whether
successful or blocked by egress filters -- is having policies and
procedures in place to facilitate packet level logging.  At least one
site that was a victim of early February 2000 DoS attacks on eCommerce
sites was not prepared for this kind of analysis, and to this day is
not aware of what attack tool was used against them.  They only knew
their routers were crashing and relied on their upstream provider to
determine how to block packets to restore throughput.  This results in
a major roadblock to investigation by law enforcement, who have been
criticized heavily by some for their slow response (it is a
non-trivial problem to perform an investigation of a DoS or DDoS
attack with nothing but router or browser response behavioral
observations to go on.)  A description of the details of the attack on
Yahoo! was published on Packet Storm Security's web site [11], but
not many other details were available.  (This was also pointed out by
Anonymous [20] in his/her post.)

Unlike the high volume mass intrusions witnessed with trinoo, TFN, and
stacheldraht in 1999, this particular mstream network appears to be in
the very early stages of code development and to have been set up by
hand (on both handler and agent systems) with a slightly modified
Linux rootkit version 4 [10] to conceal the presence of the intruder's
activity.  For a description of intrusion and concealment on an agent
system, see Appendix D.  For a description of intrusion and concealment
on a handler system, see Appendix E.


The network: client(s)-->handler(s)-->agent(s)-->victim(s)
------------------------------------------------------------

The mstream network, like trinoo and shaft, is made up of one or more
handlers ("master.c") and a large set of agents ("server.c").  Attacker
to handler communication is at present unencrypted over TCP, with
handler <-> agent communication unencrypted over UDP.

An mstream network would look like this:

                  +----------+           +----------+
                  | attacker |           | attacker |
                  +----------+           +----------+
                       |                      |

                |                      |                       |
. . . ---+------+-----+------------+---+--------+------------+-+-- . . .
         |            |            |            |            |
         |            |            |            |            |
     +-------+    +-------+    +-------+    +-------+    +-------+
     | agent |    | agent |    | agent |    | agent |    | agent |
     +-------+    +-------+    +-------+    +-------+    +-------+



Communication
-------------

    Attacker to handler(s):	6723/tcp  (in published source)
				15104/tcp ("in the wild")
				12754/tcp (in recovered source)
    Agent to Handler(s):	9325/udp  (in published source)
				6838/udp  ("in the wild")
    Handler to agent(s):	7983/udp  (in published source)
				10498/udp ("in the wild")

Remote control of the mstream handler is accomplished via a TCP
connection to port 6723/tcp (or 15104/tcp, or 12754/tcp, or...).

The handler expects commands to be contained entirely in the data
payload of a single TCP packet, not broken up character by character
in a stream.  This means that "telnet" cannot be used to control a
handler, but instead some other client program must be used to buffer
the command line before sending (e.g., a special command shell or port
redirector, netcat [19], etc. -- no special client was included in the
source posted on Security Focus [20]).

The traffic over this connection is not encrypted (although it has been
shown in stacheldraht that adding a Blowfish block cipher is not
difficult.)  Command lines are space separated argument lists.

Like trinoo, communication between the handler(s) and agent(s) is
accomplished using UDP datagrams.  Agent commands are slash ("/")
separated argument lists, with some multi-item arguments being colon
(":") separated lists.

[It is believed that the difference between attacker <-> handler
communication port numbers between "lsof" output on a system running an
active handler and that in the recovered source code is due to version
differences.  That is, the recovered source may have been an older
version than the source used to compile the handler actually running at
the time.  Both ports are identified here, although they are trivial to
change to something else (and were found to be different in the
published source [20]).]

The examined code limits the maximum number of connected attackers to 3.
This may be a protective measure, or possibly a redundant access measure
in case one or more systems used as intermediaries by the attacker are
discovered or otherwise taken out of service.

After connecting, the user must supply the proper password (default is
"N7%diApf!" in the recovered code, and "sex" in the published code
[20]).  If the proper password is not given, all currently connected
users are notified of the attempt and the connection is dropped.  If the
proper password is given, all currently connected users are informed of
the new session and the user is presented with a "> " prompt.


Handler Commands
----------------

The handler commands consist of up to 3 space-delimited fields.

If a connected attacker does not enter a command within 420 seconds,
the connection is terminated.  (It is assumed "420" was not chosen
simply because 7 minutes is an ideal timeout value. ;)

The handler command set is:

help
	Prints the following:

        Available commands:
        stream		stream attack !
        servers		Prints all known servers.
        ping		ping all servers.
        who		tells you the ips of the people logged in
        mstream		lets you stream more than one ip at a time

servers
	List all currently known agents.

who
	Shows the currently connected users.

ping
	Identify remaining active agents.  Sends the command "ping" to
	all known agents and reports to the connected users as each
	"pong" reply is received.

stream <hostname> <seconds>
	Begin an attack against a single host, for the specified
	duration.  The handler resolves the hostname to an IP address
	and sends the command "mstream/arg1:arg1/arg2" to all agents,
	where "arg1" is the resolved hosts' IP address twice with a
	colon between (this simplifies argument parsing in the agent)
	and "arg2" is the duration in seconds.

mstream <ip1:ip2:ip3:...> <seconds>
	Begin an attack against multiple IP addresses, for the specified
	duration.  The handler sends the command "mstream/arg1/arg2" to
	all agents, where "arg1" is the list of colon separated IP
	addresses, and "arg2" is the duration in seconds.  Also for
	simplicity, in this command, there is no host name resolution
	(i.e., you MUST specify all targets by a properly formed colon
	separated list of IP addresses)

quit
	Terminates the attacker's connection to the handler.


Agent Commands
--------------

The handler communicates to agents using string based commands
in the data portion of UDP packets.  These commands are not encrypted
(although this, too, can easily be changed.)

There are only three agent commands currently.  Commands are either
a simple string, or a slash ("/") separated command and argument list.

ping
	Replies to IP address that sent this packet with "pong".

stream/IP/seconds
	Starts streaming at IP address for specified duration in
	seconds.

mstream/IP1[:IP2[:IPN]]/seconds
	Starts streaming at all of the colon separated list of IP
	addresses for specified duration in seconds.

Even though the agent "in the wild" had two options for accepting DDoS 
commands, namely "stream" and "mstream" as in the published source, only 
the mstream command is used in the handler to agent protocol. A simple 
"stream 192.168.0.100 10" command to the handler sends the powerful 
command "mstream/192.168.0.100:192.168.0.100/10" to the agent, when in 
fact a simple "stream/192.168.0.100/10" should be generated. It is not 
clear why this was done, but it does look like simple algorithms are used
for command parsing, so this might just indicate a "quick and dirty"
development process.


Password protection
-------------------

The handler is password protected, to prevent trivial takeover of
the network handler.  The password is not encrypted, just a string
that is compared against the data paylod of the initial packet as-is.

It should be explicitly noted here again that this program has a feature
not found in other DDoS tools, which informs all connected users of
access, sucessful or not, to the handler(s) by competing parties (black
hat or white hat).  Thus it does not matter that you can identify the
password string in the binary, since you can't use it without detection
(and can't simply hijack the TCP session, either, because of the command
buffering described in the Communication section.)

There is no password protection of handler <-> agent communication,
but that isn't surprising. As was seen with trinoo, a password in clear
text is not much of a defense and is trivially attacked by sniffing
network traffic.


Fingerprints
------------

As mentioned above, command strings between the handler(s) and
agent(s) is visible in packet flows.

for the handler as well) is seen with "lsof" as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugs in the source code for both handler and agent result in an
increasing number of raw sockets and UDP sockets in the agent (three
each are were witnessed on this agent), and an increasing number of
open file handles and UDP sockets in the handler (hundreds were shown
by Andrew Korty).  [This is no doubt an indication that mstream is in the
early development stages, so this signature should not be counted on
to identify a handler or agent running on a system.]

When an agent first starts up, it sends a "newserver" command to 
the list of default handlers compiled into it, as seen here with
tcpdump:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
00:04:38.530000 192.168.0.20.1081 > 192.168.0.100.6838: udp 9

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a rootkit is in place (as it was on both handler and agent
systems), you cannot trust the standard operating system
commands to show you the running handler or agent, or their
network connections.  The main lesson to be learned from rootkits is
that a large percentage of Unix system administrators will NOT be
skilled enough to get around rootkits.  This means a couple things.

First, and fundamentally, intruders will tend to have an even greater
advantage over unskilled system administrators.  It is becoming ever
more important that systems administrators -- Unix, NT, whatever --
have training as a primary task, not a luxury or burden to be avoided.
The moment of a security incident is NOT the proper time to catch up on
months of missed learning, and causes undue pressure to take shortcuts
to get the system back up quickly (usually making things MUCH worse).

Second, incident response and forensic investigation may be made more
difficult, if not impossible, as the simple "solution" that the
unskilled Unix administrator will take is to give up an just re-install
the operating system.  This ill-advised choice of action destroys any
evidence that may exist on the system and sets the system up for a
subsequent intrusion because the same security precautions they did not
take before the incident will usually not be taken this time either.
All too often, this action is taken without first seeking advice and
before incident response teams are able to notify the administrator and
assist them in taking the correct steps.  All system administrators are
urged to take the time now to prepare to deal with rootkits [10].

As mentioned above, if an agent receives a UDP packet on port
10498/udp, containing the string "ping" as its data payload (and if it
is not actively streaming at the time), it will reply to the sending
system with a UDP packet on port 6838/udp with the string "pong" as
its data payload. (The trailing zeroes are just a tcpdump artifact.
The payload is clearly 4 bytes.)

This sequence allows signature matching with programs like "ngrep" [14],
"snort" [18] (see Appendix B for snort rules), or scanning for idle
agents using "rid" [15] (see Appendix C for a RID template).

The ngrep command string to detect these packets would be:

	# ngrep "p[oi]ng" udp port 6838 or udp port 10498

(You will need to tailor this command, or add the other ports listed
above from the published code, to decrease the chance of false
negatives.)

Attack packets have a fixed size of 40 bytes per packet, which may be
on purpose to evade large packet triggers that exist on some IDSs.

The stream2.c attack floods the victim with TCP ACK packets, using
forged source addresses generated by random() (i.e., any or all
of the four octets will occasionally be zero) and incrementing source
port and sequence numbers, as seen in this code snippet:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 . . .
    for(i=0;;++i) {
    cksum.pseudo.saddr = packet.ip.ip_src.s_addr = random();
       ++packet.ip.ip_id;
       ++packet.tcp.th_sport;
       ++packet.tcp.th_seq;

       if (!dstport)
          s_in.sin_port = packet.tcp.th_dport = rand();
 . . .
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During an attack, the following packet signature would be observed
(as seen by tcpdump using a recovered agent binary):

It should also be noted that some of the forged source addresses are
broadcast addresses, multicast addresses, or network addresses,
which can have ramifications if packets are directed back to the
flooding systems (see [12]).

Analysis of the de-compiled agent source code shows the stream2.c
attack is altered slightly to randomize more header fields, with some
static values that can be noted when analyzing network traffic:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  packet.ip.ip_id = rand();
  . . .
  packet.tcp.th_win = htons(16384);
  . . .
  packet.tcp.th_seq = random();
  . . .
  packet.tcp.th_sport = rand();
  packet.tcp.th_dport = rand();
  . . .
  while (time(0) <= endtime) {
    if (floodtype != 0) {
      i = 0;
      while (arg4[i] != NULL) { /* until list exhausted */
        if (strchr(arg4[i],'.') != NULL) { /* valid ip */
          packet.ip.ip_dst.s_addr = inet_addr(arg4[i]);
          cksum.pseudo.daddr = inet_addr(arg4[i]);
          s_sin.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(arg4[i]);

          cksum.pseudo.saddr = packet.ip.ip_src.s_addr = random();
          packet.ip.ip_id++;
          packet.tcp.th_sport++;
          packet.tcp.th_seq++;

          s_in.sin_port = packet.tcp.th_dport = rand();
  . . .
         }
      }
    }
  }
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Defenses
--------

There are none.  We are all doomed.  Time to shop for property in
Montana and stock up on non-perishable food items and semi-automatic
weapons.

(Seriously, we didn't have time to finish this section.  Any defenses
already discussed for stream/stream2 [12] or other DDoS tools [08]
would apply.  And for God's sake, SECURE ALL THOSE SYSTEMS they are
using to build these networks! ;)


Weaknesses
----------

Control communication (attacker <-> handler and handler <-> agent)
is not encrypted, and is thus subject to session hijacking and
third-party control, respectively.  Agents do not authenticate the
source of commands, so you can easily use the "ping"/"pong" feature to
detect agents that are not currently streaming.

In fact, "pong" is the only response sent back to the handler, and
"newserver" is only sent to handler(s) when the program first starts.
(The installation of the agent described in Appendix D causes it to be
run after each boot.  This would mean a set of "newserver" packets could
be detected at this point, although it is not recommended that rebooting
be used as the first step in verifying an agent installation.  It is
better to follow the more thorough forensic analysis techniques detailed
in Appendices D and E to ensure as little evidence as possible is
deleted or altered.)

The agent will segmentation fault upon receiving a badly formatted
command, e.g.  "stream foo bar". It is conceivable that such
fault generation can disable agents, but they will most likely get 
restarted at the next reboot of the host.

Flooding an agent with requests will saturate its file handle limit
and cause it to become unresponsive. Since no notification or
acknowledgement is made to the handler, one can easily send >1024
commands to the agent. Most floods are short, so it may be possible to
"squeeze in there".

The agent process is single-threaded, implying that it will not
process incoming commands while in mid-flood.  This renders any ideas
about remotely crashing or halting a flooding agent unworkable.

The agent also will, in multi-flood mode, flood all hosts in the
colon-delimited list equally for the same amount of time.  This seems
to either implicate packet loss due to congestion or require that
multiple flooding machines with different flood durations were in play
to explain evidence witnessed in argus flows at third party sites,
showing the side-effects of multiple targets being hit at the same
time with spoofed IPs (namely ICMP "Host Unreachable" packets and TCP
RST packets).

One thing that has been witnessed is that when there are multiple
targets which start at the same time there is a tailing-off with some
targets being hit longer than others and the rate of spoofed packets
also seems to decline with time - sort of dwindling.  (We ran out
of time to analyze third-party effects of flooding, but there will
no doubt be followup on this topic on BUGTRAQ.)


The next logical evolutionary steps
-----------------------------------

It is not a stretch to assume that features from other published DDoS
tools will make their way into tools like mstream.  Briefly, some 
likely enhancements to this code include:

1) Adding source port filtering for connections to handler.
2) Adding authentication between handler and agent.
3) Packet size selection.
4) Flags for flood packets (ACK, RST, NUL, random, whatever).
5) Encryption for attacker<->handler traffic.
6) More obfuscation of embedded commands.

Since last fall, I've spent every major holiday analyzing a DDoS tool.
Halloween (trinoo), Thanksgiving (TFN), Christmas (stacheldraht) and
New Years (building/testing scanning tools for all three).  Sven
Dietrich (no, we are not related and are not the same person as some
have mistaken! ;) took the lead on analyzing "shaft" [07] along with
Neil Long, allowing me to actually relax a bit on President's and
Valentine's days.

Then some DDoS attacks brought mstream out of the shadows, and over the
Easter Holiday weekend George Weaver kicked butt hand-decompiling the
agent, Sven Dietrich obtaining packet and system call traces on a test
network, and Neil Long gathering third-party effects data to correlate
with actual attacks, while I analyzed forensic data gathered from an
agent system and tried to keep up with the rest.  Its amazing what can
get done when four people consume that much sweets and hard boiled
eggs.

Credit also goes to Andrew Korty and investigators at Indiana
University for their forensic analysis and data gathering.  Site to
site cooperation and coordination is key to incident response in DDoS
attacks, and the more people who know about this and learn the
techniques, the better off we'll all be.

I should also thank Anonymous, who posted the source code for mtsream
through Security Focus [20], acknowledging me by name for my earlier
work.  My only reservation is that the result of publishing the source
(instead of sending it to me directly) was to alter all of our weekend
plans to rush this analysis out (e.g., I was planning on doing a
training hike all day Sunday.) Whoever you are, I should think you owe
me at least a sixer of good microbrew for that! ;)  (The upside is that
this simplifies the problem of getting code into the hands of all
vendors, incident response teams, and security software authors in a
fair and above board way.)

Appendix D - Initial Intrusion and Concealment on Agent system
--------------------------------------------------------------

Examination of an agent system, and interviewing the owner, identified
what looks like possibly two separate compromises.  One sometime
before March 31, 2000 (a password file entry for "inertia" existed
until removed by the system owner on April 1), the transfer and
installation of a rootkit (lrk4) and DDoS agent ("rpc.wall") on April
13 16:02 (all times, unless otherwise noted, are US/Pacific, or
GMT-0700), and the marks of an ADM named attack and login on April 15
05:55.  System logs had been deleted and/or scrubbed, so log evidence
was not useful in determining what occurred on the system.

Some of these activities can still be identified using the "mactime"
program, part of Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema's "Coroner's Toolkit"
[16]. [The date "100" is, obviously, a Perl Y2K bug in the "mactime"
program.  This software was graciously provided by Dan Farmer, even
though it is not publicly available at this time.  It definitely
shows how useful Unix forensic analysis tools can be.]

From this listing, the following observations can be made:

o On April 13 at 16:02, /bin/login was created and /bin/chown run.

o At the same time, the compile was run (gcc/egcs) and /bin/old and
  /bin/xstat created.  Access times on the .h files listed show the
  program being compiled uses network libraries.

o Next, the /etc/rc.d/rc.local file is modified to include the
  line "/usr/bin/rpc.wall" at the end, thus re-starting the agent on
  each reboot. ncftp logging files are modified (they were deleted
  and turned into links to /dev/null to disable logging of ncftp
  file transfers.)

o The program /usr/bin/rpc.wall was modified, and C runtime libraries
  accessed, which implies it was run.  (This cannot be confirmed
  because the rootkit prevented the program from being seen by
  the administrator, who also rebooted the system and restarted it,
  thus modifying the /usr/bin/rpc.wall access date.)

o On April 15 at 05:55, it appears that the ADM named buffer overrun
  exploit was used against this system, followed within the minute
  access to a tcpd wrapped service which invoked in.telnetd.
  The rootkit configuration file /usr/libexec/awk/addy.awk was
  also accessed.  [It is not clear if this was a just a coincidental
  second (third?) intrusion attempt.]

o Six seconds later /usr/bin/pico was run and the vt200 terminfo
  definition was accessed.  Since the trojan version of login contains
  the string "vt200", this confirms the backdoor that was installed
  two days earlier was used to gain root access.

While the /etc/passwd entry for the "inertia" account had been deleted
by the administrator of the system, the /etc/shadow entry (original
modification date not known) was not:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
inertia:iUCNir1cd8pI2:::::::
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The password, "hi", was cracked in a fraction of a second.

Strings in "/bin/login" show the classic trojan horse signs of a path
to a non-standard program ("/usr/bin/xstat") and embedded terminal
type ("vt200") that triggers a root shell:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 . . .
login
/bin/sh
/usr/bin/xstat
TERM
bcshjvmudzwxftejk
vt200
%s=%s
init.c
 . . .
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strings in "/bin/ls" and "/bin/ps" show the names of the rootkit
configuration files to be "/usr/libexec/awk/files.awk" and
"/usr/libexec/awk/ps.awk" (respectively).  Another configuration file is
seen above, "/usr/libexec/awk/addy.awk".

The big tipoff that this is a standard Linux rootkit is the compiler
inserted debugging information that includes the (edited) path to the
source file, which had better not be a valid path on Red Hat's
development system:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 . . .
ls.c
/home/XXXXX/stuff/lrk4/fileutils-3.13/src/
gcc2_compiled.
int:t1=r1;-2147483648;2147483647;
char:t2=r2;0;127;
 . . .
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since telnetd was not otherwise used on the system (instead SSH was used
for remote login), the intruder placed an entry (date unknown) in
/etc/inetd.conf to run in.telnetd as service "working":

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 . . .
#finger	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/sbin/tcpd	in.fingerd
#cfinger stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/sbin/tcpd	in.cfingerd
#systat	stream	tcp	nowait	guest	/usr/sbin/tcpd	/bin/ps	-auwwx
#netstat	stream	tcp	nowait	guest	/usr/sbin/tcpd	/bin/netstat	-f inet
working	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/sbin/tcpd	in.telnetd
 . . .
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following entry was added (date unknown) to the /etc/services file
for this service:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
working		1120/tcp			# Kerberos working daemon
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This service port is shown in (edited) "lsof" output as listening:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
inetd      353     root    4u  IPv4        375               UDP *:talk

inetd      353     root   12u  IPv4        381               TCP *:linuxconf (LISTEN)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was noted earlier that the trojan version of /bin/login allows access
using a terminal type of "vt200" (as seen by strings in the binary), and
that the mactime output shows the termcap entries for vt200 are accessed
right after the backdoor in.telnetd was accessed.  This places the last
login to the system using this backdoor at approximately 05:56 on April
15 (per the system's clock).  This is within the time window of one
of the attacks logged by the network operations engineers (Apr 15
04:11:35 to 07:32:22).


Appendix E - Analysis of handler system from Indiana University
---------------------------------------------------------------

[Note - this, too, was edited prior to publication.]


On 20 April 2000 the IT Security Office at Indiana University was
contacted by Dave Dittrich of the University of Washington (and
subsequently by Penn State).  A system had been identified attempting to
use an agent similar to Trinoo to initiate denial of service attacks
using spoofed source addresses.  The agent binary contained an IP
address for a host on one of IU's networks.

Our first step was to have our networks group block all traffic to
and from this IP address and log any inbound attempts.  The main
intention was to prevent the machine from causing more trouble,
but we also wanted to keep the intruder from closing up shop once
our presence was known.  We avoided rebooting the machine and making
physical changes to the network (e.g., unplugging the LAN cable)
in case the software running on the machine was able to detect such
events and delete itself.

Once the system was isolated from the rest of the network, we ran
the lsof program, the output of which can be found at the end of
this report.

This output indicates a process rpc.wall listening on several UDP
ports, including 6838, to which Mr. Dittrich had noted his agent
process had been sending packets.  The /usr/bin/... has been opened
for reading hundreds of times.  This file contained a list of IP
addresses, enciphered by a simple ASCII rotation.  These IP addresses
seem to be those of agent servers controlled by this master.
Indeed, the identified agent system was on the list.  We found a similar
file, /dev/grab/..., which we think might have been used by another
master server.

An example line from one of these files might look like

	ckd`chj`cc`jb<

The cipher merely adds 50 to the ASCII value of each character, so the
resulting IP is

	192.168.11.80

Such a file can be translated by passing it through the UNIX command

	tr 'b-k`' '0-9.' | sed 's/<$//'

Using this translation, we found 76 IP addresses on the system,
presumably all DDoS slave agents.

Source code for the rpc.wall program was found by searching through
the raw disk.  The attacker had done a good job of deleting the
original source file but failed to use the -pipe option to gcc.
Preprocessed code was therefore written to a temporary file to be
passed to the compiler proper.  Though this temporary file was
deleted from the filesystem by the compiler, the data itself remained
intact on the disk.

Analyzing the source code of this program, we found it can perform
"stream" as well as "mstream" attacks.  An mstream attack is
apparently a simultaneous stream attack on multiple IPs.  We believe
this added functionality could result in larger-scale DDoS attacks
than we have seen before.

The source code found is included at the end of this report.

At this point we felt we had most of the important evidence, so we
used the dd program to copy the entire filesystem over the network
to my notebook.  From there we could mount the file readonly and
examine it later.  Here's what we have found so far:

ROOT KIT

A root kit called flukek.tgz was found in /bin.  It contains
replacements for, among many others, cron, in.timed, inetd, login,
named, passwd, rshd, syslogd, tcpd.  The following files were added
to /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, and /usr/sbin since the system was
installed.  Nothing appeared to have been added to /usr/libexec or
anything under /usr/local.  Times listed are inode change times.  The
file /usr/bin/old appears to be the old login binary.

-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   2387704 Dec 18 16:37 bin/flukek.tgz
-r-sr-xr-x  1 root  daemon    12656 Apr 13 23:39 bin/login

-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel     37056 Mar 31 20:09 usr/sbin/ndc

No libraries, kernel modules, or PAM modules appear to have been
replaced.

ACCOUNTS ADDED

The /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files were recently modified:

-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  849 Feb 17 00:57 /mnt/etc/passwd
-rw-------  1 root  wheel  884 Feb 17 00:57 /mnt/etc/passwd-
-r--------  1 root  wheel  794 Feb 17 00:57 /mnt/etc/shadow
-r--------  1 root  wheel  658 Nov 15 10:07 /mnt/etc/shadow-

The backup of /etc/shadow made 15 November gives us a clue what
accounts were added:

	www:MyjKA0KGHplq6:11004:0:99999:7:::
	login1:MyjKA0KGHplq6:11004:0:99999:7:::
	web:af47L/OTL7K6.:11004:0:99999:7:::
	x::11004:0:99999:7:::

I have not yet attempted to crack these passwords.  I did try to
log in as "x" but was denied access.

INETD SERVICE ADDED

Inspection of /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf reveals a service
called "a", running in.telnetd on TCP port 1111, has been added.

/etc/services:

	a 1111/tcp

/etc/inetd.conf

	a stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd in.telnetd

I haven't attempted to connect to it yet.
