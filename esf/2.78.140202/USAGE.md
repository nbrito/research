Nelson Brito <nbrito@protonmail.com>

Usage:
    "ESF.pl host[/CIDR] [options]"

Options:
    "/CIDR"
        Configures the CIDR (*Classless Inter-Domain Routing*), which builds
        a range of IPv4 addresses (see CIDR for further information).

    "-b,--brute-force" (default OFF)
        Configures the BRUTE FORCE MODE, which drives SQL Fingerprint NG to
        perform PROTOCOL GATHERING on pre-defined TCP ports ("-p,--ports"),
        by checking for a valid "TDS Pre-Login Response" (see BRUTE FORCE
        MODE for further information).

            *NOTE: This option is not available on public releases.*

    "-d,--debug" (default OFF)
        Configures the DEBUG MODE, which gives further detailed information
        about the fingerprinting tasks.

            *NOTE: This option disables both VSAM and ESAM.*

    "-f,--fingerdb FILE" (default "ESF.db")
        Configures an optional SQL Fingerprint NG Database file.

    "-h,-?,--help"
        Displays the help and usage message.

    "-H,--highest" (default OFF)
        Displays HIGHEST Score and MULTIPLE HIGHEST Score messages for both
        VSAM and ESAM (see HIGHEST Score and MULTIPLE HIGHEST Score for
        further information).

    "-i,--ignore" (default OFF)
        Configures the IGNORE MODE, which forces SQL Fingerprint NG to
        ignore missing SQL Fingerprint NG Database file, as well as
        corrupted and/or invalid SQL Fingerprint NG Database file.

    "-I,--instance" (default OFF)
        Displays instance(s) name ("Default Instances" as well as "Named
        Instances") for both VSAM and ESAM.

    "-m,--manpage"
        Displays the manual page embedded in SQL Fingerprint NG, which is
        the manual page in POD (Plain Old Documentation) format.

    "-p,--ports NUM:NUM" (default 1024:65535)
        Configures TCP ports, which are the TCP ports used by BRUTE FORCE
        MODE.

            *NOTE: This option is not available on public releases.*

    "-P,--prelogin" (default OFF)
        Configures "TDS Pre-Login Request" only, which avoids "SSRP Client
        Unicast Instance Request".

    "-s,--suppress" (default OFF)
        Configures the SUPPRESS MODE, which suppresses the VSAM messages.

            *NOTE: This option is not available on public releases.*

    "-S,--scan" (default OFF)
        Configures the SCAN MODE, which uses the ESAM to score the
        vulnerabilities and their exploitability.

            *NOTE: This option is not available on public releases.*

    "-t,--timeout NUM" (default 30)
        Configures a specific connection timeout (seconds), which allows SQL
        Fingerprint NG to wait until close the connection.

    "-T,--loop-timeout NUM" (default 5)
        Configures a specific timeout (seconds), which allows SQL
        Fingerprint NG to wait until execute the next "STEP" in the "LOOP".

    "-v,--verbose" (default OFF)
        Configures the VERBOSE MODE, which gives detailed information about
        the fingerprinting tasks.
