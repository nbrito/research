Description:
	The recently reported worm appears to also be using the
	fingerd(8) daemon to enter systems.  Here's a fix.

	The previous patch for sendmail(8) on binary systems only
	prevented the current attacker.  The attached patch fixes
	the problem.
Fix:
	Re-patch sendmail.  Recompile and reinstall the attached
	source for fingerd(8).

	Here's a script to repatch sendmail.  Note, this only applies
	to binary systems, if you have source you should have recompiled
	and reinstalled it already.  You should start with the original
	sendmail binary, NOT the binary that you've already patched.
	AND, REMEMBER, ALWAYS SAVE AN EXTRA COPY IN CASE YOU MAKE A
	MISTAKE!!  Finally, if you don't find the string ``debug'' in
	your sendmail binary, you don't have a problem; ignore this patch.
	This patch essentially makes it impossible to set the debug flag.

	Note, your offsets as printed by adb may vary!  Comments are
	preceded by a hash mark, don't type them in, nor expect adb
	to print them out.  Also, we're again using strings(1) to find
	the decimal offset in the file of certain strings.  To find 
	out if your strings(1) command prints offsets in decimal, 
	put 8 control (non-printable) characters in a file, followed
	by four printable characters, and then use strings(1) to find
	the offset of your four printable characters.  If the offset
	is ``8'', it's using decimal, if it's ``10'' it's using octal.
